Adam, 2020 -
	Removed files and utilities unecessary for the operation of Netkit-JH:
 CVS, gdb, gdbbot, honeypot, humfsify, jail, jailtest, moo, port-helper,
uml_net, umlfs, umlgdb, watchdog, and uml_util.spec.in.
	Replace uml_switch's files with Jeff Dike's versions for uml_dump.
	uml_dump was added.


BB -
	shebangs added where needed
	fixed the command line handling in honeypot.pl
	the jail Makefile installs things now
	jail_uml handles user names as well as uids and sets its group
	CFLAGS is now settable at the top level
	cleanups in uml_mconsole
	64-bit fixes, fixing of broken 64-bit COW files, and other
cleanups in uml_moo
	bug fix in uml_net's handling of a SLIP interface going down
	moved the uml_router directory to uml_switch
	cleanups in uml_switch
	added a spec file

Me -
	BB's tarball contained a tools-$DATE with a tools subdirectory - the
	subdirectory had newer stuff, so I started with that.

	Cleaned up the honeypot.pl changes

	Spurious tab in jail/Makefile

	Ignored BB's redeclaration of jailtest main - I prefer correct
declarations even when the arguments aren't used.

	Removed uml_util.spec, which is generated

	Added a lib directory which contains send_fd()

	Added umlfs and umlfs support to uml_mconsole
